"""Actionable errors — every user-facing error names the fix.

UX audit F6: "Error messages don't teach."  The typed exceptions raised
by the init/forge artifact code tell you *what* failed (``RefResolutionError``,
``LockfileMismatch``, ``CIStateMismatch``, ``FragmentShapeMismatch``), not
*what to do about it*.

Slice UX-B introduces :class:`ActionableError`, a base exception class
that carries a ``fix`` string and an optional ``docs_url`` alongside its
message.  Every top-level command catches it at its outer boundary and
prints a single Rich panel with both the symptom and the fix, then exits
non-zero.  Example printed output:

    ❌ LockfileMismatch: fragments/builds/main.yaml has been edited but
       contract.lock.yaml is out of date.
       Fix: run 'fluid compile' and commit the updated contract.bundled.yaml
            and contract.lock.yaml.
       Docs: https://fluid-build.dev/docs/fragments#lockfile

The idea — and the shape — is borrowed from ``cargo``, ``rustc``, and
``git`` which all wrap their errors in a "how to recover" line.  Users
coming from those tools expect it; users who haven't seen it before
discover an out without having to read docs.

Migration strategy
------------------

Slice UX-B lands the base class, the pretty-printer, and a small
``raise_actionable`` helper.  It migrates the most-commonly-hit error
sites (ref resolution, YAML parse failures inside forge scaffolding)
to the new class.  Remaining ``raise RuntimeError / ValueError`` sites
stay unchanged — they continue to produce plain error output — and can
be converted one at a time as users discover them.  This keeps the
surface of this slice small and reversible.

    ----------
    message:

        sentence — anything longer belongs in the fix line or the docs.
    fix:
        One-line description of the exact command or action the user
        should take next.  Should start with a verb ("Run …", "Delete
        …", "Check …").  This is the whole point of the class.
