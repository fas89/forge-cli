"""Source-discovery CLI for ``fluid init --discover <connection-uri>``.

Introspects a live source and emits a deterministic Bronze contract for every
discoverable stream. Supported source kinds:

  - ``postgres://...``   — full schema/table introspection via DuckDB postgres_scan
  - ``mysql://...``      — same via mysql_scan
  - ``sqlite:///...``    — via sqlite_scan
  - ``s3://`` / ``file://`` / ``https://`` — filesystem (CSV / Parquet / JSONL)

The output is a list of ``contract.<id>.fluid.yaml`` files plus an optional
``<contract>.suggested-pii.yaml`` that captures classifications discovered
during the introspection.

This is the **deterministic** forge path for Bronze. AI-mode forge is
governed by ``contract.py::apply_suggestion`` which honors the same
suggestion-file contract.
