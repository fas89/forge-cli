"""Receipt builder — per-run manifest of everything init/forge wrote.

After a successful ``fluid init`` or ``fluid forge`` run, the CLI writes
a JSON receipt listing every file it created/updated/skipped, with
sha256s and the inputs that drove the run.  The receipt lives under
``<workspace>/.fluid/init-receipt.json`` (init) or
``<product>/.fluid/forge-receipt.json`` (forge) and is *gitignored* —
it's a machine-local record, not team state.

The receipt enables three things:

1. **Dry-run diffing.**  ``fluid init --dry-run`` produces the same JSON
   with ``action: "would-create"`` and no filesystem writes.  Re-running
   for real produces an identical shape with ``action: "create"``, so the
   two can be diffed to prove parity.

2. **Rollback.**  A future ``fluid uninstall <run_id>`` reads the receipt
   and removes only paths whose sha256 still matches what was recorded —
   refusing to touch anything the user has since hand-edited.

3. **Auditability.**  CI can attach the receipt as a build artifact.
   ``git log`` on a teammate's clone has no idea what your machine did;
   the receipt does.

Design notes
------------

* Receipts are last-only.  Each run overwrites the previous receipt.
  There is no append-only history (per the UX decision in the plan —
  can be added later if users ask).
* Receipts are gitignored.  See the git-policy matrix in the plan.
* The receipt class does not call ``ArtifactWriter`` to write itself —
  it builds a ``ReceiptDocument`` that the caller hands to the writer.
  This keeps receipts testable in isolation without filesystem I/O.
