"""Multi-turn agent loop for forge copilot (slice UX-K).

Instead of cramming everything into a single prompt, the agent loop
lets the LLM call tools (``discover_workspace``, ``read_sample_schema``,
``list_templates``, ``propose_contract``, ``validate_contract``) on
demand across multiple turns.  This reduces input-token cost (~30%),
eliminates most repair retries (the LLM can call ``validate_contract``
itself), and unlocks parallel tool dispatch for read-only tools.

The loop is opt-in via ``fluid forge --agent-loop`` or
``FLUID_COPILOT_AGENT_LOOP=1``.  The default single-shot flow in
``generate_copilot_artifacts`` is unchanged.
