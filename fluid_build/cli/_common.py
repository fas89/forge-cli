    """Auto-find ``contract.fluid.yaml`` in CWD when ``args.contract`` is empty.

    UX hardening pass — every command that takes a positional ``contract``
    should accept the bare ``fluid <verb>`` invocation when CWD has a
    single contract. ``validate`` already does this; this helper makes
    the same behaviour available to ``bundle`` / ``plan`` / ``apply``
    / ``policy-apply`` / ``publish`` so the user doesn't have to type
    ``contract.fluid.yaml`` four times for one workflow.

    Mutates ``args.contract`` in place when a CWD contract is found.
    Returns ``True`` if it filled the slot, ``False`` if there was no
    contract to find (caller raises the canonical "contract required"
    error). Idempotent: a non-empty ``args.contract`` is left alone.

    SECURITY (S-014): rejects symlinks. ``Path.is_file()`` follows
    symlinks by default, so a malicious actor with write access to
    CWD could plant a symlink ``contract.fluid.yaml`` pointing at an
    out-of-tree file (``/etc/passwd``, ``../../../sensitive.yaml``)
    and have a subsequent ``fluid <verb>`` operate on that target.
    The auto-find path explicitly skips symlinks; the operator can
    still pass an explicit symlinked path via the positional arg if
    they really want one — that's an intentional choice, not an
    auto-resolution.

    ``fluid bundle`` (pipeline stage 1) emits a gzip tarball whose payload
    includes ``contract.resolved.{yaml,json}`` plus a tamper-evident
    ``MANIFEST.json``. ``fluid validate`` already understands this layout
    (see ``cli/validate.py::_run_bundle_validation`` → ``validate_bundle``);
    ``plan`` / ``apply`` did not — they handed the ``.tgz`` straight to the
    text loader, which tried to UTF-8-decode gzip bytes and crashed with
    ``'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b``.

    This helper makes the bundle path work by reusing the exact pieces
    ``validate`` uses:

      1. ``validate_manifest`` — the SHA-256 tamper gate. A bundle that
         fails here is rejected before any contract bytes are parsed.
      2. ``contract.resolved.yaml`` (preferred) or ``contract.resolved.json``
         is read with the bounded reader (decompression-bomb cap) and
         parsed via ``loader.parse_contract_text`` — same billion-laughs
         guard as the on-disk path.
      3. ``unwrap_source_pointers`` resolves any ``{"$source": "sources/…"}``
         sentinels (inline SQL / OpenAPI that ``fluid bundle`` extracts into
         ``sources/``) back into real values, so downstream planners see a
         fully-materialised contract — never a bare sentinel dict.

    The returned contract is exactly what the planner / apply path would
    have seen had the operator passed the original ``contract.fluid.yaml``,
    so ``plan`` / ``apply`` can treat ``.tgz`` and raw contracts uniformly.

    """Recursively resolve ``{{ env.VAR }}`` placeholders in every string leaf.

    ``plan``/``apply``/``verify`` resolve these per-string at the Snowflake
    provider boundary (``providers/snowflake/plan/planner.py``), but ``publish``
    forwards the raw contract dict to the catalog adapter — so without this
    pass, raw placeholders like ``{{ env.SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE }}`` land in the
    DMM server block and render in the UI as-is.

    Unresolved placeholders (env var missing) are left intact so callers can
    decide whether to error, warn, or fall back — matching the per-string
    helper's behavior.

    Defense-in-depth: placeholders whose *name* looks like a credential
    (``{{ env.SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD }}``, ``{{ env.DMM_API_KEY }}``, etc.) are
    left literal — the resolved contract is serialized back to YAML and
    shipped to the remote catalog, so resolving a secret-shaped placeholder
    here would silently exfiltrate the credential. A WARNING is emitted once
    per-variable-per-call so operators notice the unresolved placeholder
    rather than assume resolution succeeded.
