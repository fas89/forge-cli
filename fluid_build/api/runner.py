"""Runner Protocol — the contract every ingestion runtime implements.

A Runner ingests data from an external source (described by a SourceSpec)
and lands it at a destination (described by a SinkSpec), per the contract's
acquisition pattern. State, lineage, metrics, and hooks come in via the
RunContext; the runner is otherwise a pure function of inputs.
