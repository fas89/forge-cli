"""Dead-Letter Queue writer.

Records failing PII classification, schema validation, quality gates, or
destination write are routed here. Each DLQ record carries: payload,
failure reason, hook chain trace, run id, timestamp.

When ``maxRecordsBeforeAbort`` is exceeded, the run transitions to
``failed`` and the lock is released — the runner consults
``DLQOverflowError`` to decide.
