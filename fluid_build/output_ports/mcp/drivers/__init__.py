"""Driver registry for the consumer MCP output-port server.

Drivers are keyed on ``(binding.platform, binding.format)``. The
registry intentionally lives in this module (rather than the
top-level ``providers/__init__.py``) because consumer-side drivers
are a separate concern from the build-side providers and have a
narrower surface (just ``execute`` + ``health_check`` rather than
``plan`` / ``apply`` / ``render``).

Out-of-tree drivers can register themselves at runtime via
:func:`register_driver`. Internal teams that ship a Databricks /
Postgres / Redshift driver as a private wheel only need to:

1. Subclass :class:`fluid_build.output_ports.mcp.drivers.base.EngineDriver`.
2. Call ``register_driver(("databricks", "delta_table"), DatabricksDriver)``
   from the wheel's ``__init__``.
