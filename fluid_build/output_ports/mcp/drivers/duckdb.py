"""DuckDB driver for the consumer MCP output-port server.

DuckDB is the Phase-1 reference driver because:

* No cloud credentials needed — the cert script and integration
  tests can run in any sandbox.
* DuckDB is the engine FLUID's ``local`` provider already uses
  (see ``fluid_build.engines.dbt_duckdb``), so a consumer who
  developed a contract locally can serve it via MCP without changing
  a line.
* The dialect is close enough to BigQuery / Snowflake that the same
  query-compiler output runs on all three engines (parameter syntax
  is the only meaningful difference).

Connection model:

* If ``binding.location.path`` is set, opens that file (read-only).
* Else opens an in-memory database — used by tests to load CSV
  fixtures and serve them as exposes.
* The optional ``binding.location.attach`` list can carry additional
  files to attach (e.g. a parquet manifest); each entry must be a
  string filesystem path that resolves under the server's
  ``readable_paths`` allowlist.
