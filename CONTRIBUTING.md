# Contributing to FLUID Forge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FLUID Forge! This guide will help you get started.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge-cli/issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue using the **Bug Report** template.
3. Include:
   - FLUID Forge version (`fluid version`)
   - Python version (`python3 --version`)
   - Operating system
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behaviour
   - Contract YAML (redact any secrets)

### Suggesting Features

1. Open an issue using the **Feature Request** template.
2. Describe the problem you'd like to solve, not just the solution.
3. If the feature involves a new provider, use the **Provider Request** template instead.

### Branching Strategy

All contributions target the `main` branch. Use the following branch name prefixes:

| Prefix | Use for | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New features | `feat/databricks-provider` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/validate-empty-contract` |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes (in this repo) | `docs/update-quickstart` |
| `provider/` | New or updated providers | `provider/azure-support` |
| `refactor/` | Code cleanup, no behaviour change | `refactor/simplify-loader` |
| `chore/` | CI, dependencies, maintenance | `chore/bump-ruff-version` |
| `test/` | Test improvements | `test/add-provider-registry-tests` |

### CI Gates on `main`

All PRs to `main` must pass these checks before merge:

| Check | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Lint & Format** | `ruff check` + `black --check` (Python 3.12) |
| **Test Matrix** | `pytest` on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (randomized order) |
| **Coverage Gates** | Core 80%, local providers 50%, cloud providers 20% (Python 3.12) |
| **Security Scan** | `bandit` with medium severity threshold |
| **Build Smoke Test** | Wheel build + install verification |
| **License Headers** | All `.py` files must have Apache 2.0 header |
| **Docs Reminder** | Soft check — adds `needs-docs` label if no docs reference |

PRs also require at least **1 approving review** from a [CODEOWNER](https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge-cli/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS).

### Submitting Code

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

2. **Install** in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev,local]"
   ```

3. **Make your changes.** Follow the coding standards below.

4. **Add tests.** All new code must include tests. Run the suite:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. **Lint and format:**
   ```bash
   ruff check fluid_build/ tests/
   black fluid_build/ tests/
   ```

6. **Add license headers** to any new Python files:
   ```bash
   python scripts/add_license_headers.py
   ```

7. **Commit** with a clear message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```
   feat(provider): add Databricks provider skeleton
   fix(cli): handle empty contract in validate
   docs: update quickstart for v0.8
   ```

8. **Address documentation** — see [Documentation Requirements](#documentation-requirements) below.

9. **Push** and open a Pull Request against `main`.

## Documentation Requirements

We maintain documentation in a **separate repository**: [Agentics-Rising/forge_docs](https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge_docs).

Every PR that changes user-facing behaviour must be paired with a documentation update. When you open a PR, the template asks you to choose one of:

1. **Link a docs PR** — open a companion PR in [forge_docs](https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge_docs) and paste the link in your CLI PR description.
2. **No docs needed** — check the box and provide a justification (e.g. internal refactor, test-only change, CI config update).
3. **Docs TODO** — acknowledge that docs are needed and commit to creating the docs PR before your CLI PR is merged.

A GitHub Actions workflow (`docs-reminder`) will automatically label your PR with `needs-docs` if none of these are addressed.

### What counts as needing docs?

- New CLI commands or flags
- Changed command behaviour or output
- New or updated providers
- Configuration changes
- Breaking changes
- New environment variables or setup steps

### What does NOT need docs?

- Internal refactors with no behaviour change
- Test-only changes
- CI/CD configuration updates
- Dependency bumps

### How to create a docs PR

The documentation site lives in a separate repo. To create a companion docs PR:

1. Fork and clone [Agentics-Rising/forge_docs](https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge_docs).
2. Create a branch with the same name as your CLI branch (e.g. `feat/databricks-provider`).
3. Make your documentation changes (Markdown files under `docs/`).
4. Preview locally: `pip install mkdocs-material && mkdocs serve`
5. Push and open a PR against `main` in forge_docs.
6. Paste the docs PR link in your CLI PR description under the "Documentation" section.

**Tip:** open the docs PR as a draft first, then finalize it alongside your CLI PR review.

## Coding Standards

- **Python 3.9+** — no walrus operators in hot paths, use `from __future__ import annotations` sparingly.
- **Type hints** on all public function signatures.
- **Logging** — use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` in production code, never bare `print()`.
- **No bare `except:`** — always catch specific exceptions.
- **Tests** — use `pytest`. Place unit tests in `tests/`, provider integration tests under `tests/providers/`.
- **Imports** — standard library → third-party → local, separated by blank lines. Use `ruff` to auto-sort.

## Testing Best Practices

### Coverage Gates

CI enforces a **three-tier coverage strategy**:

| Gate | Threshold | What's included |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Core framework** | 80% | All `fluid_build/` except providers and `provider_action_executor.py` |
| **Local providers** | 50% | Providers that don't need cloud credentials (local, catalogs, ODCS, etc.) |
| **Cloud providers** | 20% | Providers requiring cloud credentials (AWS, GCP, Snowflake, etc.) |

Run coverage locally before pushing:

```bash
# Full test suite with coverage
pytest --cov=fluid_build --cov-report=term-missing -q

# Check core gate
coverage report --fail-under=80 \
  --omit="fluid_build/providers/*,fluid_build/cli/provider_action_executor.py"
```

### Writing Good Tests

**Test behaviour, not implementation.** A test should verify *what* a function produces, not *how* it does it internally. If a test breaks when you refactor without changing behaviour, the test is too tightly coupled.

```python
# BAD: tests implementation details (which internal function was called)
def test_validate_calls_schema_checker(self):
    with patch("fluid_build.cli.validate._check_schema") as mock:
        validate(contract)
    mock.assert_called_once()

# GOOD: tests observable behaviour (return value, side effects)
def test_validate_returns_errors_for_invalid_contract(self):
    result = validate(invalid_contract)
    assert result.is_valid is False
    assert "missing required field" in result.errors[0].message
```

**Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for variant testing.** If you're writing multiple test methods that differ only by input/output, combine them:

```python
# BAD: 5 copy-paste methods
def test_infer_bool(self):
    assert infer_type("bool") == "boolean"
def test_infer_int(self):
    assert infer_type("int64") == "integer"

# GOOD: 1 parametrized test
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_type,expected", [
    ("bool", "boolean"),
    ("int64", "integer"),
    ("float32", "number"),
    ("timestamp", "datetime"),
    ("utf8", "string"),
])
def test_infer_type(self, input_type, expected):
    assert infer_type(input_type) == expected
```

**Mock only at boundaries.** Use real objects when they're cheap (dataclasses, simple classes). Reserve mocking for:
- Network calls (HTTP, gRPC)
- File system operations
- External SDKs (boto3, google-cloud, snowflake-connector)
- Time-dependent logic (`time.time()`, `datetime.now()`)

**Use helper factories for test data:**

```python
def _make_contract(name="test", version="1.0", **overrides):
    defaults = {"id": name, "version": version, "spec": "v1"}
    defaults.update(overrides)
    return defaults
```

### Async Tests

We support Python 3.9+ which requires manual async handling (no `@pytest.mark.asyncio`). Use this pattern:

```python
import asyncio

def _run(coro):
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    try:
        return loop.run_until_complete(coro)
    finally:
        loop.close()

def test_async_function(self):
    result = _run(my_async_function())
    assert result == expected
```

### Test Isolation

Tests run in **randomized order** (via `pytest-randomly`). Every test must:
- Clean up any files it creates (use `tmp_path` fixture)
- Not depend on execution order
- Not leak global state (environment variables, module-level caches)

If a test fails only when run in the full suite, it has a hidden dependency on test ordering.

## Provider Contributions

If you're building a new provider:

1. Read the [Provider SDK documentation](https://agentics-rising.github.io/forge_docs/providers/).
2. Subclass `BaseProvider` from `fluid_provider_sdk`.
3. Register via entry points in your `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [project.entry-points."fluid_build.providers"]
   my_provider = "my_package:MyProvider"
   ```
4. Include at least one working example contract.
5. See the [provider documentation](https://agentics-rising.github.io/forge_docs/providers/) for internals.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge-cli.git
