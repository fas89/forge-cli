## 🌊 What is FLUID?

**FLUID** (Federated Layered Universal Instructional Declaration) is an open-source declarative framework for building, validating, and deploying data products across any cloud. You write a single YAML contract describing *what* your data product is — its schema, quality rules, access policies, and scheduling — and FLUID Forge compiles that into provider-specific infrastructure (BigQuery, Snowflake, AWS Glue, Athena, or local DuckDB) with full governance baked in.

Think of it as **Terraform for data products**: one contract, many clouds, zero boilerplate.

```
contract.fluid.yaml  →  fluid validate  →  fluid plan  →  fluid apply
       (declare)          (check)           (preview)       (deploy)
```

---

## 🤯 Why We Built This

Data engineering is stuck in the dark ages of imperative spaghetti code. You want to ship data products fast, but compliance teams demand governance. You end up with **Configuration Sprawl**: `.tf` files for Terraform, `schema.yml` for dbt, `.rego` for OPA, and a web of Airflow DAGs.

**FLUID Forge is the compiler that ends the chaos.** You declare what your data product *is*. The CLI compiles that into a validated, deterministic execution plan across any supported cloud.

### The Old Way vs. The FLUID Way

| 🛑 **The Old Way** (Imperative Chaos) | ✨ **The FLUID Way** (Declarative Order) |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Weeks of boilerplate to wire up IaC, SQL, and DAGs. | **Minutes** to deploy. Just declare your intent and apply. |
| Vendor lock-in. Your DAGs only work on one cloud. | **Provider-agnostic.** Switch clouds by changing one line of YAML. |
| Governance as an afterthought. Manual compliance tickets. | **Governance-as-Code.** Policies compile to native IAM before deployment. |
| "Works on my machine." Broken production deploys. | **Deterministic plans.** See exactly what will change before it runs. |
| AI hallucinations. Agents don't understand your tables. | **Semantic Truth.** Built-in OSI semantics so LLMs query perfectly. |

## ⚡ 60 Seconds to Magic

Data engineering shouldn't require weeks of handwritten infrastructure code, bespoke CI/CD pipelines, and copy-pasted SQL.

**What Terraform did for infrastructure, FLUID Forge does for data products.**

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
pip install fluid-forge

# 2. Validate your data product contract
fluid validate contract.fluid.yaml

# 3. See exactly what will happen
fluid plan contract.fluid.yaml

# 4. Deploy infrastructure, logic, and governance — instantly
fluid apply contract.fluid.yaml
```

That's it. You just deployed a **versioned, governed, and orchestrated Data Product** from a single YAML file.

> **Want to move from local to Google Cloud?**
> `pip install "fluid-forge[gcp]"` → change `platform: local` to `platform: gcp` → run `fluid apply`. **Done.**

### Installing additional providers

Once the base install is working, add cloud providers as needed:

```bash
pip install -e ".[gcp]"         # + Google Cloud (BigQuery, GCS, Composer)
pip install -e ".[snowflake]"   # + Snowflake
pip install -e ".[all]"         # Everything (all providers + dev tools)
```



## 🧬 Anatomy of a FLUID Contract

Everything starts with `contract.fluid.yaml` — the **single source of truth** for your data product's entire lifecycle.

```yaml
fluidVersion: "0.7.1"
kind: DataProduct
id: example.customer_360
name: Customer 360
domain: analytics

metadata:
  layer: Gold
  owner:
    team: data-platform
    email: platform@example.com

# 1. THE LOGIC — How is it built?
builds:
  - id: transform_customer
    pattern: embedded-logic
    engine: sql
    properties:
      sql: |
        SELECT user_id, email, LTV
        FROM raw.users JOIN raw.orders USING (user_id)

# 2. THE INTERFACE — What does it output?
exposes:
  - exposeId: customer_profiles
    kind: table
    binding:
      platform: snowflake              # ← Change to 'gcp' or 'aws' instantly
      format: snowflake_table
      location:
        database: PROD
        schema: GOLD
        table: CUST_360
    contract:
      schema:
        - name: email
          type: string
          sensitivity: pii             # ← Triggers auto-masking/encryption

# 3. THE GOVERNANCE — Who (or what) can access it?
accessPolicy:
  grants:
    - principal: "group:marketing@example.com"
      permissions: ["read"]

agentPolicy:                           # ← Agentic Era Governance
  allowedModels: ["gpt-4", "claude-3"]
  allowedUseCases: ["analysis", "summarization"]
```

## 🔌 Providers — Bring Your Own Cloud

Providers are the bridge between your declarative contract and your target execution environment.

| Provider | Target Ecosystem | Superpowers |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 💻 **local** | DuckDB, Local FS | Zero-config. Runs anywhere. Perfect for dev/test. |
| ☁️ **gcp** | Google Cloud | BigQuery, GCS, Composer (Airflow), Dataform, IAM. |
| 🌩️ **aws** | Amazon Web Services | S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift, MWAA, IAM. |
| ❄️ **snowflake** | Snowflake | Databases, schemas, streams, tasks, RBAC, sharing. |

> Export-only providers for open data standards: **odps**, **odcs**, **datamesh-manager**.

## 🛠️ Installation

FLUID Forge is modular. Install only what you need.

```bash
pip install fluid-forge                # Minimal — CLI + Local/DuckDB provider
pip install "fluid-forge[gcp]"         # + Google Cloud
pip install "fluid-forge[aws]"         # + AWS
pip install "fluid-forge[snowflake]"   # + Snowflake
pip install "fluid-forge[all]"         # Everything
```

> 💡 **Tip:** We recommend [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) for an isolated global install:
> `pipx install "fluid-forge[all]"`

---

## 💻 CLI Command Reference

FLUID Forge is designed to feel as natural as `git` or `terraform`.

### Core Lifecycle

```bash
fluid init                           # Scaffold a new Data Product contract
fluid validate contract.fluid.yaml   # Validate schema, dependencies, syntax
fluid plan contract.fluid.yaml       # Generate a deterministic execution plan
fluid apply contract.fluid.yaml      # Execute the plan against your target provider
fluid verify contract.fluid.yaml     # Post-deployment data quality & compliance checks
```

### AI & Code Generation

```bash
fluid forge                                  # 🤖 Interactive, AI-powered project creation
fluid generate-airflow contract.fluid.yaml   # Compile contract → native Airflow DAG
