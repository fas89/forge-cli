"""Backward-compatibility regression guard for v0.7.3 schema additions.

The v0.7.3 changes are purely additive (new optional fields, new pattern
in an enum, new $defs entries). They MUST NOT make any previously-valid
contract invalid. This test:

  1. Discovers every example contract under examples/.
  2. Validates each against its own declared fluidVersion.
  3. Treats pre-existing failures (contracts that don't validate against
     their declared version even on main) as out of scope and skips them.
  4. Asserts every contract that previously validated continues to validate.

Anything that breaks the 0.7.x → 0.7.3 additive promise will trip this.
