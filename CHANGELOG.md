## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Master-schema validation on DMM publish (opt-in enforcement; default preserves prior behavior).** `fluid datamesh-manager publish` (alias `fluid dmm publish`) now validates the loaded FLUID contract against the bundled master schema (currently `fluid-schema-0.7.2.json`) before constructing any provider payload, enforcing the CLI's role as master coordinator. **The default mode is `warn` — existing workflows are NOT affected: a contract that previously published will still publish, schema errors are logged, and the publish proceeds.** Users who want hard enforcement opt in via `--validation-mode strict`, which aborts the publish with a detailed error summary on any schema violation. Unit tests cover both modes plus the valid-contract-in-strict-mode happy path and an end-to-end integration test that walks the full pipeline without mocking the provider.
- **Migrated all 13 bundled templates to FLUID 0.7.2.** Mechanical migration of `builds[*].pattern` (`single-stage` → `embedded-logic`), `consumes[*]` legacy file-reference entries (removed — templates consume files via build SQL, not as upstream data products), `metadata` strict fields (dropped `sla`/`orchestration`/`environment`/`pattern`), DQ rule types (`validity` → `valid_values`, `consistency` → `accuracy`), DQ severities (`warning` → `warn`), operators (`=` → `==`), and trigger types (`scheduled` → `schedule`). All 13 templates now pass strict validation against `fluid-schema-0.7.2.json`.
- **`init --blank` scaffold now emits a valid 0.7.2 contract** (with a placeholder expose so the generated document passes the `exposes.minItems: 1` constraint out of the box).
- **ODPS input-port lineage** — `OdpsStandardProvider` now maps FLUID `consumes[]` entries to ODPS-Bitol `inputPorts`, so upstream data-product lineage is preserved when publishing to Entropy Data (datamesh-manager `provider_hint="odps"`).
- **Cross-version compatibility matrix** — new `tests/test_contract_compatibility_matrix.py` parameterizes a small set of golden fixture contracts (minimal 0.5.7/0.7.1/0.7.2, lineage 0.7.1/0.7.2) across schema validation and every export path (ODCS, official OPDS, ODPS-Bitol, DMM DPS dry-run, DMM ODPS dry-run). Guards against silent regressions across FLUID schema bumps.
- **`consumes_to_canonical_ports` / `get_owner` / `slugify_identifier` helpers** in `fluid_build/util/contract.py` — shared normalization used by both ODPS providers and the CLI init path.
- **FLUID 0.7.2 bundled schema** added to the fallback set in `FluidSchemaManager._discover_bundled_versions`, plus a new `latest_bundled_version()` classmethod so the "latest version" is resolved once and centrally.

### Changed
- **`fluid_build.cli.validate` exposes a public `run_on_contract_dict(...)` helper** (plus a public `output_text_results` alias) that other CLI commands can use to validate an already-loaded contract dict with identical UX to `fluid validate`. The DMM publish path is the first caller; the private `_output_text_results` name is no longer reached into.
- **`get_owner` precedence flipped** to the 0.7.2-canonical order: `metadata.owner` first, with top-level `owner` kept as the legacy fallback. Matches the master schema (which forbids top-level `owner` under `additionalProperties: false`).
- **`consumes_to_canonical_ports` now forwards the complete 0.7.2 `consumeRef` field set** (`versionConstraint`, `qosExpectations`, `requiredPolicies`, `tags`, `labels`) in addition to the legacy extension fields. Providers can forward any subset without re-parsing the raw contract. Non-mapping/non-list values on typed fields degrade to `None` for predictable downstream checks.
- **`slugify_identifier` leading-digit guard now applies to the fallback too**, so numeric or punctuation-only fallbacks still produce valid FLUID identifiers. Both input and fallback are slug-cleaned before the guard runs; if both collapse to empty, a single-character sentinel (`"x"`) is returned rather than an invalid identifier.
- **`init.py::generate_contracts_from_scan` emits 0.7.2-shaped contracts.** `kind: DataProduct`, `fluidVersion`, `metadata.owner`, and per-expose `binding.platform` / `binding.location` / `contract.schema` — matching the bundled master schema. `apply_governance_policies` and `show_migration_summary` migrated in lock-step; both still read the legacy `produces[]` shape as a fallback to avoid breaking in-flight callers.
- **Removed dead helpers** from `fluid_build/util/contract.py`: `get_expose_schema`, `get_expose_format`, `normalize_expose`, `normalize_contract`. These were silently wrong for 0.7.2 (reading fields that 0.7.2 `additionalProperties: false` rejects or producing outputs that don't satisfy the 0.7.2 `binding` shape), had zero production callers, and only existed to keep their own tests green. Associated test classes removed.
- **End-to-end publish integration test added** (`tests/cli/test_datamesh_manager.py::TestCmdPublishEndToEnd`) that walks through the full pipeline — on-disk 0.7.2 fixture → loader → master-schema validation → `DataMeshManagerProvider.apply(dry_run=True)` → payload assertions — without mocking the provider. Catches any wiring regression along the publish chain that unit tests with mocks would paper over.
- **ODPS input ports no longer fabricate `contractId` or default `required: True`.** Fields that were not explicitly declared on a `consumes[]` entry are omitted from the output rather than filled with synthetic defaults. Downstream consumers see only fields that point to real upstream identifiers, and pipelines are no longer implicitly marked as requiring every upstream.
- **Unified input-port extraction.** The official `OdpsProvider` and `OdpsStandardProvider` now share a single `consumes_to_canonical_ports` traversal (in `util/contract.py`) instead of reimplementing it side-by-side.
- **`OdpsStandardProvider` 0.7.x field tolerance** — reads both `expose.id`/`exposeId`, `expose.contract.schema`/`expose.schema`, `binding.platform`/`expose.provider`, `binding.location`/`expose.location`, and top-level `owner`/`description`/`domain`/`fluidVersion` as fallbacks for their `metadata.*` counterparts.
- **ODPS output ports now emit an `id` field** (previously only `name`). `contractId` on output ports is only populated when explicitly set on the expose — the DMM layer still overlays a deterministic `contractId` when publishing companion contracts.
- **`OdpsStandardProvider` raises `ProviderError`** (instead of `KeyError`) when an expose is missing both `id` and `exposeId`.
- **Malformed `consumes[]` entries are now skipped with a logged warning** rather than silently dropped.
- **CLI `init` blank mode** now uses `slugify_identifier()` to produce valid contract IDs from arbitrary project names (handles punctuation, leading digits, and non-ASCII).
- **Latest bundled FLUID version is resolved lazily** in `fluid_build/cli/init.py` and `fluid_build/cli/provider_init.py` via `_latest_fluid_version()` helpers instead of module-level constants computed at import time.
- **Templates bumped to FLUID 0.7.2.**

## [0.7.8] — 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Release version consistency** — aligned the runtime CLI version with package metadata so `fluid --version` and the published package both report `0.7.8`.
- **Release notes continuity** — added the `0.7.8` changelog section and compare link so the release history matches the version bump.

### Fixed
- **Windows timeout enforcement** — corrected the non-`SIGALRM` security timeout path so operations time out promptly instead of waiting for the worker to finish.
- **Regression coverage** — added a targeted test for the Windows timeout path to keep the fallback behavior stable.

## [0.7.7] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Forge copilot architecture refresh** — modularized the `fluid forge` copilot flow into focused runtime, context, UI, mode, and agent layers for easier iteration and maintenance.
- **Declarative domain-agent specs** — built-in YAML-backed agent specs now power domain guidance without hard-coding every interview path in Python.
- **Project-memory-aware copilot flow** — copilot generation now supports project-scoped memory and post-generation clarification loops to refine outputs with more context.

### Changed
- **Release version bump** — promoted the Forge CLI and companion Claude plugin assets to `0.7.7` to reflect the sizable copilot feature set landing in this release.

### Fixed
- **Test suite alignment with PR #8 merge** — updated tests to match new `_extract_sla_properties()` list-of-dicts return format, `_publish_odcs_per_expose()` keyword argument signature, and `dataContractId` format (`{product_id}.{expose_id}`)
- **Result URL domain** — test assertions updated to match `api.entropy-data.com` (from `app.entropy-data.com`)
- **License headers** — added Apache 2.0 headers to `tests/test_datamesh_manager_publish_spec.py` and `tests/test_odcs_sla_properties.py`

## [0.7.6] — 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Data Product payload conformance** — `PUT /api/dataproducts/{id}` now sends `dataProductSpecification: "0.0.1"`, root-level `id`, `info.title` (not `info.name`), and `info.owner` per Data Product Specification v0.0.1 schema
- **Output port server object** — output ports now send structured `server` objects (`account`, `database`, `table`) instead of flat `location` strings, matching the DPS schema
- **Result URLs** — publish result URLs now use the configured `api_url` instead of hardcoded `app.entropy-data.com`
- **`_cmd_publish()` signature bug** — all five `_cmd_*` functions in `datamesh_manager.py` now accept `(args, logger=None)` to match the CLI dispatcher in `__init__.py:432`

### Added
- **ODCS v3.1.0 data contract support** — `_build_data_contract_odcs()` generates Open Data Contract Standard v3.1.0 payloads (`apiVersion`, `kind: DataContract`, `team.name`, `description.purpose`, array-based `schema` with `logicalType` mapping)
- **`--contract-format {odcs,dcs}` CLI flag** — choose between ODCS v3.1.0 (default) and deprecated DCS 0.9.3 when publishing companion data contracts
- **`dataContractId` wiring** — output ports automatically include `dataContractId` linking to the companion contract when `--with-contract` is used
- **Archetype inference** — `info.archetype` auto-inferred from `metadata.layer` (Bronze→source-aligned, Silver→consumer-aligned, Gold→aggregate) when not explicitly set
- **SQL-to-ODCS type mapping** — `_odcs_logical_type()` maps 25+ SQL/FLUID types to ODCS logical types
- **86 tests** for `fluid dmm` subcommand (up from 40), covering DPS conformance, ODCS/DCS builders, server objects, format dispatch, and dataContractId wiring

### Deprecated
- DCS 0.9.3 data contract format — use `--contract-format dcs` for backward compatibility. Entropy Data removing DCS support after 2026-12-31.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Multi-file contract composition via `$ref`** — split contracts across multiple files using `$ref` pointers (OpenAPI-style). Refs resolve transparently in all commands (validate, plan, apply, execute). Supports external file refs, JSON pointer fragments (`file.yaml#/section`), nested/transitive refs, and subdirectory resolution. Circular reference detection and depth limiting protect against malformed contracts.
- **`fluid compile` command** — bundle a multi-file contract into a single resolved document. Supports `--out` for file output, `--env` for overlay application, and `--format json|yaml` for output format control. Equivalent to `swagger-cli bundle` for OpenAPI.
- **`compile_contract()` API** — programmatic entry point for $ref resolution in `fluid_build.loader`.
- **`RefResolutionError` exception** — clear error type for $ref failures (missing files, circular refs, invalid pointers).
- Multi-file contract example: `examples/0.7.1/bitcoin-multifile/` demonstrating team-owned fragments.
- "What is FLUID?" section in README
- CI status badge in README
- `.secrets.baseline` for detect-secrets scanning
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with detect-secrets, black, and ruff hooks
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` for code review ownership
- `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` documenting all dependency licenses
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- CLI smoke tests (`tests/cli/test_cli_smoke.py` — 28 tests)
- Config manager tests (`tests/test_config_manager.py` — 45 tests)
- `docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md` — architecture overview of SDK + CLI

### Fixed
- Removed hardcoded default password (`'admin'`) in Apache Atlas connector — now requires explicit config or `ATLAS_USERNAME`/`ATLAS_PASSWORD` env vars
- Replaced 17 occurrences of hardcoded AWS account ID `123456789012` with `YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` placeholder
- AWS Glue/SageMaker fallback role ARNs now use `self.account_id` instead of hardcoded values

### Removed
- `fluid_build/cli/admin.py` — internal admin/diagnostics command (not for public use)
- `fluid_build/cli/analytics.py` — internal telemetry module (dead code)

### Changed
- Bandit security scan in CI now blocks on failures (removed `|| true` fallback)
